    <article><h2>About Me</h2></article>
    <p>I am a creative and passionate individual with an entrepreneurial mind to help others. Right now, I am focused on creating a physical rehab business for seniors. I have specialized knowledge and experience in post knee/hip replacement, stroke rehab and fall prevention techniques. I love being able to help others, relieve some physical pain and help maintain their independence. I am registered to take my Kinesiology exam through <abbr title="College of Kinesiologists of Ontario">COKO</abbr> in April</p>
    <p>In my free time, I love developing my interests and working on my passion projects, like getting my gun license on February 17<sup>th</sup>. I like finding new classes and clubs to join, always looking to meet new people and expand my knowledge and experience. Recently I have joined a gymnastics club, Muy Thai fighting classes, pottery and painting classes, Cooking classes and a even a puzzle club. I’m always looking to learn and grow, because life is meant to be lived to it’s fullest.</p>
    <blockquote>When you <em>intentionally</em> make the expression of love a part of your <em>daily</em> practice -- that is feeling, receiving, and giving love -- not only do you boost your own immune system, but you begin to understand that the more you feel <em>love</em>, and when you become the embodiment of love, you can <em>change the world</em>. -Dr Joe Dispenza</blockquote>
